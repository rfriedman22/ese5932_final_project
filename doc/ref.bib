    abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate in phantoms
                the differences in CT image noise and artifact level between two
                types of commercial CT detectors: one with distributed
                electronics (conventional) and one with integrated electronics
                intended to decrease system electronic noise. MATERIALS AND
                METHODS: Cylindric water phantoms of 20, 30, and 40 cm in
                diameter were scanned using two CT scanners, one equipped with
                integrated detector electronics and one with distributed detector
                electronics. All other scanning parameters were identical. Scans
                were acquired at four tube potentials and 10 tube currents.
                Semianthropomorphic phantoms were scanned to mimic the shoulder
                and abdominal regions. Images of two patients were also selected
                to show the clinical values of the integrated detector. RESULTS:
                Reduction of image noise with the integrated detector depended on
                phantom size, tube potential, and tube current. Scans that had
                low detected signal had the greatest reductions in noise, up to
                40\% for a 30-cm phantom scanned using 80 kV. This noise
                reduction translated into up to 50\% in dose reduction to achieve
                equivalent image noise. Streak artifacts through regions of high
                attenuation were reduced by up to 45\% on scans obtained using
                the integrated detector. Patient images also showed superior
                image quality for the integrated detector. CONCLUSION: For the
                same applied radiation level, the use of integrated electronics
                in a CT detector showed a substantially reduced level of
                electronic noise, resulting in reductions in image noise and
                artifacts, compared with detectors having distributed
                electronics.",

  abstract  = "We propose a new definition for the gradient field of a discrete
               image defined on a twice finer grid. The differentiation process
               from an image to its gradient field is viewed as the inverse
               operation of linear integration, and the proposed mapping is
               nonlinear. Then, we define the total variation of an image as
               the $\ell_1$ norm of its gradient field amplitude. This new
               definition of the total variation yields sharp edges and has
               better isotropy than the classical definition.",

  abstract = "This paper studies gradient-based schemes for image denoising and
              deblurring problems based on the discretized total variation (TV)
              minimization model with constraints. We derive a fast algorithm
              for the constrained TV-based image deburring problem. To achieve
              this task, we combine an acceleration of the well known dual
              approach to the denoising problem with a novel monotone version
              of a fast iterative shrinkage/thresholding algorithm (FISTA) we
              have recently introduced. The resulting gradient-based algorithm
              shares a remarkable simplicity together with a proven global rate
              of convergence which is significantly better than currently known
              gradient projections-based methods. Our results are applicable to
              both the anisotropic and isotropic discretized TV functionals.
              Initial numerical results demonstrate the viability and
              efficiency of the proposed algorithms on image deblurring
              problems with box constraints.",
